This is a simple proof that Hitler's wikipedia page can or cannot be reached in 5 clicks on references to other wiki aritcles from any wiki article.

The algorithm used is BFS. It ensures that all pages at a certain "distance" from Hitler's page get iterated and their "neighbours" added before it goes to the "next distance"(prevdist + 1)

Hold tight ma dudes, we might have done it.
